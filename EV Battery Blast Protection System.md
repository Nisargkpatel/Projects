# üî• EV Battery Blast Protection System

A real-time thermal safety system for electric vehicles that monitors battery temperature and cuts off power to the BLDC motor when thermal runaway is detected ‚Äî protecting the battery from catastrophic failure.

## üìò Abstract

Electric vehicle (EV) batteries are prone to thermal runaway ‚Äî a chain reaction triggered by overheating due to overcurrent, overcharging, or external temperature. This project presents a **cost-effective, real-time blast protection system** that monitors battery temperature and uses a **relay mechanism controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller** to immediately disconnect power if unsafe temperature levels are reached.

The solution addresses core challenges in EV battery safety using simple electronics and embedded logic to provide a robust and scalable system.

## üö© Problem Statement

With increasing EV adoption, battery safety is a critical concern. Several EV fires and explosions have been attributed to poor thermal management, especially during aggressive charging/discharging. 

This system provides:
- **Instant thermal cutoff**
- **Current isolation**
- **Preventive circuit disengagement**

## üß™ Working Principle

### ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow:

1. **Continuous Temperature Monitoring**  
   The ESP32 continuously polls temperature sensor data connected to the battery casing.

2. **Threshold Comparison**  
   If the temperature exceeds a predefined limit (e.g., 60¬∞C), a digital HIGH signal is sent from a GPIO pin.

3. **Relay Activation via Transistor**  
   Since the ESP32 GPIO cannot directly drive a mechanical relay, a **BC547 transistor** is used to amplify the signal.

4. **Motor Cutoff**  
   The relay deactivates the power path to the **BLDC motor**, preventing further thermal escalation.
