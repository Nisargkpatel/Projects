# Project Showcase

This repository contains multiple innovative projects developed using microcontrollers and IoT-based technologies.

## 1. [Spider Scout](https://github.com/Nisargkpatel/Projects/blob/main/SPIDER%20SCOUT.md)
A robotic system designed for autonomous and remote-controlled exploration. It features:
- **Obstacle Avoidance** by controlling the servo angle making the leg lift vertically.
- **Wireless Control** via Bluetooth
- **Live Stream** via ESP32 CAM Module

## 2. HydroMonitor
A **smart water conservation system** that allows remote monitoring and control of water levels and motor operation. Features:
- **Remote Motor Control** via a web interface
- **Auto Cutoff** when the water tank is full
- **Daily Water Usage Reports** for efficient resource management
- **ESP32-based Implementation**

## 3. [Analog Capacitance Meter](https://github.com/Nisargkpatel/Projects/blob/main/Analog%20Capacitance%20Meter.md)
A precise capacitance measurement device based on voltage vs. time characteristics. Key features:
- **Measures up to 9.99mF** with high accuracy
- **Synchronous Counter-Based Measurement**
- **Comparator Circuit** to determine charging time
- **Displays Capacitance in Real-Time**

## 4. [EV Battery Blast Protection System](https://github.com/Nisargkpatel/Projects/blob/main/EV%20Battery%20Blast%20Protection%20System.md)
A safety-focused monitoring and control system designed for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Using an **ESP32**, it provides real-time battery status updates, remote charging control, and protection against overheating, overcharging, and short circuits. The system integrates a **Dallas DS18B20** temperature sensor for precise thermal monitoring and a **web-based interface** for remote access.
